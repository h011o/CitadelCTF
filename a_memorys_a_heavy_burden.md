# A memory's a heavy burden


## Description
> This challenge provides us with an image of Mt. Fuji and asks us to find its exact location coordinates.

## My solve

The compass direction tells us that the location is towards the north of the mountain. In our image we can see the highly distinctive japanese cemetries and the description of the challenge 
hints to us that it is possibly near a Buddhist temple. We can also see some cherry blossoms and a residental area along with a forested hill.

I then entered all this information along with the image to a location analyzer which predicted the area to be in Yamanashi.

On using the satelite view of google maps and scouting along the forested region, we see two Buddhist temple's which stands out.

Then we use the street view feautre to finally find our required location.
